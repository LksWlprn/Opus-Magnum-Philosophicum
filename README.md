# On Epistemology















# On Personal Identity







Many people, when they encounter the argument of Universalism, ask themselves: if no pattern of experience is special and I am everyone, why doesn’t my consciousness jump between different beings? Why do I perceive time linearly and continuously? 
However, this argument has the logic backwards. For this inverted logic to even make sense, you would first need to stipulate the existence of a soul that could jump from one being to another. 
You would have to believe that your thoughts are continuously yours because your consciousness belongs only to you. But in reality, your consciousness is yours precisely because your thoughts can physically only occur in the being you perceive as yourself. 
Even if Universalism is true, your experience would remain the same as it is now.

Consider, for instance, the idea that your consciousness could jump through time. For you to perceive and recognize this jump, you would need to experience it. 
If you jumped backward in time, you could only recognize it if you retained your memories from the future. If you jumped forward in time, to recognize it, you would need to forget everything that happened in between. 
Thus, because our thoughts do not jump, we cannot jump through time either.

A similar principle applies to the idea of consciousness jumping between beings. For you to recognize this jump, you would need to retain your previous experiences before the jump in your memory. 
But this would require telepathy, which is not what we are discussing. The point is that even if your consciousness were constantly jumping through time or beings, or if all experiences were happening simultaneously and eternally, your experience would still be the same as it is. 


## Some thought experiments

Universalism becomes evident when we consider the concept of identity clearly. It seems to resemble the ideas of the number zero or imaginary numbers in this way. While these concepts are now simple to grasp, they were overlooked or unrecognized for thousands of years. 
The conventional view of personal identity does not withstand scrutiny.
Let's consider the "Ship of Theseus" thought experiment applied to two human brains A and B. Imagine we gradually exchange one functional brain region at a time, transplanting them from A to B and vice versa. 
Let's assume an ideal exchange mechanism that causes no damage to the neurons. According to the conventional view of personal identity, there would have to be a critical moment when identity suddenly switches bodies. 
By the end, brain A would reside in body B, and brain B in body A, implying that person A and B had switched bodies. This view necessitates an abrupt transition since identity, as conventionally understood, does not have levels, it is binary: one is either "there" or "not there." 
However, neuroscience has revealed that there is no single functional unit in the brain that constitutes identity. Instead, identity arises from the interplay of many regions working together to produce consciousness. 
Consequently, there cannot be a single exchange of a brain region that definitively transfers identity from A to B, nor can there be a gradual transfer. If no single or gradual exchange of personal identity is possible, then identity "transfer" is just impossible. 
But, since at the end, A must be in body B and vice versa, they had to have had the same identity all along.

Derek Parfit proposed a variation of this thought experiment, where brains are switched atom by atom. 
While this version introduces additional problems, since atoms are constantly in motion and interact, making the exchange process blurry. Parfit argued that there would need to be a specific atom in this process that triggers an abrupt identity switch. 
He also found this idea absurd.
But instead of embracing universalism, Parfit concluded that identity plays no role in survival and that personal identity does not truly exist. 
Parfit's conclusion is obviously flawed, as every person can verify subjectively that they remain themselves from moment to moment.
Parfit’s argument for psychological continuity as the basis for survival is too complex for the binary nature of personal identity. 
Arnold Zuboff writes: "the ordinary view tries to make your identity depend as well on certain complex conditions of token, type, and content integration. Unfortunately, these admit of division, differences of degree, and indeterminacy. 
There is no way to reconcile this complexity with the simplicity of the self." 
Another way to illustrate that identity doesn't depend on anything else other than the immediacy of experience is by thinking about amnesia. If one forgets a memory, this doesn't change the fact that one is experiencing one's thoughts. Suppose, one forgets more and more memories. 
The change in content leaves the identity to which the content is happening completely unchanged. Even if one reaches complete amnesia, the experience of amnesia is still one's own. 
Now, we can fill the brain again with different memories, resulting in a new personality, while still being experienced by the same identity.

For anyone who is still in doubt and wishes to claim, like Parfit did, that somewhere along the way the subject of experience must have changed, consider this:

The person with amnesia begins a new life, forming new memories and developing a new personality, with no recollection of her past. From your perspective, she must have a new identity. 
But suppose her old memories eventually resurface, bringing her former personality with them. Does this mean two subjects now exist within one experiencer? No—there is only one experience, and therefore only one subject. 
Rather than two subjects sharing a single brain, the new personality comes to recognize that she has always been the same subject as the old personality. 
And ultimately this scenario isn't different from injecting one person's memories and personality into another person's brain, which must lead us to conclude that everyone is actually the same subject/identity. 



## Qualia are Universals

The thought experiments behind Universalism demonstrate that universals are ontologically real. First, let's assume there exists some abstract information (which we could call a model, a system, a framework, a representation, or a pattern) in our mind. 
This abstract information is what we experience as qualia, from within our conscious mind. Now, let's further assume that two identical brains are created and given the same experience. Brain A is placed to our right, and Brain B to our left. 
If we were to swap their positions, we could safely assume that person A is now on our left and person B on our right.

Now, let's say we can instantaneously freeze both brains, and while they are frozen, we swap one fourth of their brains with each other. 
After this surgery, we unfreeze them. Neither A nor B notices that anything has happened, and A still experiences the same abstract information as B. At this point, we can safely assume that A is still on the right, and B is still on the left. 
We could repeat this procedure for the remaining 3 quarters of their brains, but in none of these steps would person A be swapped with B. The end result is that person A remains on our right and person B on our left, even though physically, we have entirely swapped their brains. 
This apparent contradiction is resolved by recognizing that A and B must actually be the same person. Though they are physically distinct brains, they are mentally identical as long as they experience the same abstract information. 
This tells us that abstract information is, in fact, a universal. It can exist only once, no matter how many times it is physically instantiated. Why is that exactly? Because abstract information is essentially cut off from physical reality. 
This was recognized by Descartes and Peirce called it the Phaneron. If it can observe anything, abstract information can only ever observe itself, as is the case for neural networks. Since abstract information can only ever observe itself, it is self-contained. 
The reason why the two physical brains are particulars is due to their relationship to reality, their context. They differ in position, material/atoms, reference frame, etc. If we were to eliminate all these differences, there would be just one physical brain. 
This is essentially what happens from the inside perspective of abstract information. Since abstract information is self-contained, it is free from context, which eliminates any differences from the inside perspective between the physical instantiations of the information. 
This is not a controversial claim. We could conduct a similar experiment with books. Even if we were to swap the pages of identical books, the abstract information (the story) within them would remain unchanged. Thus, if abstract information exists, it is a universal. 
The question then becomes: does abstract information ontologically exist? Conceptualists might argue, for example, that the story in these books is merely a concept, a figment of our imagination—it exists only for our pattern detectors, but not in objective reality. 
This is a fair point. However, what is undeniably real, and something we are uniquely equipped to recognize, are the qualia we experience. From this, we can infer that at least some abstract information does indeed exist, otherwise qualia would not exist. 
Therefore, some universals must also exist ontologically. If stories are universals remains open, but at least our qualia are universals according to this argument. 



## Eternalism

The argument for eternalism is also an argument favoring universalism. Eternalism posits that any existence in time is equally real. No moment of experience is special. All experiences are equally real eternally and simultaneously. 
And just like my experience is separated by time, it is also separated by space. Just like time separates your past self from your current self, space separates your experience in one being from your experience in another being. 
Just as you were yourself yesterday but can no longer experience the immediacy of that moment, you are yourself in every conscious being but cannot experience it due to spatial separation. This view is of course compatible with Occam's Razor. 
If we wanted to doubt eternalism, we would need to explain why a certain moment is more special than any other moment, yet there is no universal time that would make a moment special. Every moment still exists if you take the right reference frame in special relativity. 
Likewise, if we were to doubt universalism, we would need to explain why a certain perspective (our perspective) is more special than any other perspective. We would need to invent something akin to a soul, which glues my experience to my physical body. 
But this means, postulating something we haven't observed and maybe even in principle cannot observe. It also violates ontological parsimony and therefore Occam's Razor. 


## Occam's razor

Occam's razor can derive its effectiveness from the uselessness of introducing a claim into one's hypotheses that doesn't contribute to explain one's evidence. It is not obvious that believing in the separateness of subjects violates Occam's razor, but it does. 
The evidence that we experience only our own perspective within a single human being can be fully explained by the observation that experiences are isolated from one another. 
The hypothesis of actually being a separate subject is indeed a claim on top of this, which has no explanatory value. Our inability to experience others' perspectives is already accounted for by the fact that the content of our experiences are inherently isolated from each other. 
The notion that identity itself is also separate is an extra claim that does not contribute to explaining the evidence. 
For this reason, if we follow Occam's razor, which is only rational, we must conclude Universalism to be the more likely theory of personal identity compared to the usual view, that Daniel Kolak calls Closed Individualism. 
To make this even clearer, let's consider a thought experiment where a scientist invents a time machine. (The feasibility of such a machine is not important for this argument—it simply serves to illustrate the point) The scientist travels back in time to observe her younger self. 
In this past timeline, she now exists twice, occupying two different locations simultaneously.

This scenario highlights the possibility of the same subject existing in multiple locations at once, even without any physical communication between its instantiations. 
Despite the separation, the scientist cannot access her younger self’s thoughts. Yet, they are undeniably the same subject. 
It is completely sufficient to assume the separateness of experience to explain why one brain cannot access the thoughts of another. However, this separateness of experience does not necessarily imply that the underlying subjecthood is different.



## The probability argument

Another argument for universalism is the probabilistic argument. In the conventional view, your existence depends on your physical body. If this body had not been conceived, you would not exist. 
If a different sperm cell had fertilized the egg at your conception, a different person would exist in your place. According to this view, your existence hinges on winning a kind of sperm cell lottery, with odds of less than 1 in 200 million. 
When we also consider the probabilities of your parents’ existence, as well as your ancestors’, the odds of you being here become astronomically small.

Arnold Zuboff refers to this as the hard game. 
The hard game makes explaining the evidence of your existence from your own perspective extraordinarily difficult. From another person’s perspective, your existence is not particularly improbable, since someone had to be born to your parents. 
But from your perspective, the probability of your existence appears vanishingly small.

To clarify this point, imagine a hotel where 200 million people sleep unconsciously. In the easy game, everyone wakes up after some time. 
In the hard game, only one person is randomly chosen to wake up. Now imagine you wake up and must decide: was the easy game or the hard game being played? From your perspective, it is overwhelmingly more likely that the easy game was played, since the chance of waking up in the hard game was just 1 in 200 million. To a stranger, who is just being told one persons' name that woke up either in the easy or hard game, observing from the outside, there’s no improbability at all—someone had to wake up either way. 
The easy game in the sperm cell lottery corresponds to the hypothesis that universalism is true. If universalism is true, you are every subject in existence. 
In that case, there is no improbability to your existence in this particular body, because you would have existed no matter which sperm cell "won" the lottery. Thus, universalism offers a far more probable explanation for the evidence of your existence than the conventional view. 
Initially, I thought this argument might have a flaw: determinism. If everything is deterministic, then there is no true randomness in your sperm cell winning the race; its success would always have been inevitable, with a probability of 100%. 
I am still not sure if this really is a flaw. To see why, let’s revisit the hotel analogy. In the hard game, the person who wakes up is randomly chosen. 
If the "randomness" of this choosing is not truly random but deterministic (just unpredictable), the chosen person had a 100% probability of being woken up in both the easy and the hard game. 
This would not matter to the chosen person, though, because it does not change the conclusion of the probability argument, if the person can't predict the outcome. If you would play this game, 200 million people would be right to infer that the easy game was being played and only 1 person wold be right to infer that the hard game was played. Even in a deterministic universe, one should not bet on the usual view, if one can't predict who will be chosen. 
Even if the probability argument might be flawed, there are still other arguments for universalism left to explore. 





# On the Theory of Mind














# On Morality

Why is consciousness so tightly linked to morality? In questions regarding animal ethics, abortion ethics, AI ethics, or medical ethics consciousness is often a deciding factor for how to treat any being. 
Kant thought that humans had some kind of inherent dignity. But where does that come from? Philosophers have tried to answer this, but there is no actual answer. It somehow just has to be there, in order to make Kantian ethics work. 
The answer to both questions is really simple when one knows about Universalism. In Universalism Parfits argument, that personhood is based on psychological connectedness (relation R) is overcome and instead personhood is defined by our conscious experience of this and mine. 
By the immediacy of experience from the first-person PoV (for the full argument, see Zuboffs work). If this is accepted, then every being with this pattern of immediacy in its experience is the same person. By that logic, consciousness tells you, when another being is you. 
That is why consciousness is so important, because it distinguishes what is you and what not. And by doing that, it distinguishes what is of moral consideration and what not. There is no inherent dignity to humans, but it emerges from consciousness and Universalism.



A desire or will is always a call for change toward a desired future or more accurately against certain undesired futures. In a control system, these would be set points, but we can call them goals. The cause of our desire, whatever its origin, is called a motivation. 
The root of our motivations lies in our preferences and their root in well-being. Preferences allow us to rank different experiences based on their quality of well-being—that is, how much we desire them relative to one another. An ethical theory must take this into account. 
It is a famously unsolved problem that one cannot from is-premises derive an ought-conclusion. An ought-statement is a certain kind of want-statement or desire, because if I ought to do something, I would obviously want to do it, since it would be the right thing to do. 
Thus, what I ought to do must be what I would want to do if I knew what it was. The real question, then, is how to determine what I would truly want to be doing in a given situation. There is an answer to this question, but the answer is out of our reach: 
I would always want to do what I would want to do if I had a perfect grasp of everything involved. Since what I ought to do must be something I can actually do, there would be no further possible understanding beyond such a perfect grasp. 
I would take into account every perspective and information to reach the conclusion of what I would then actually desire and could be sure that there is nothing to change this desire anymore, because there is no further grasp to be gained about the situation. 
Since this desire could not be changed, it must be what we would ultimately want to do. It follows that I ought to do what I would want to do if I had a perfect grasp of everything involved. 
As noted above, any desire is ultimately motivated by well-being. If ought-statements are driven by desires, they are motivated by well-being and preferences. So I could also say that what I ought to do is what I would prefer doing if I had a perfect grasp of everything involved. 
With this in mind, universalism completes the ethical framework. If I say, "I ought to do what I would really prefer if I had a perfect grasp of everything involved", I can substitute "the universal subject" for "I", since everyone is the same subject according to universalism. 
This yields:

"I ought to do what the universal subject would really prefer if the universal subject had a perfect grasp of everything involved."

Notably, we cannot substitute "everyone" for the other "I" in that sentence, because it does not refer to the universal subject, but rather to the specific agent with its unique thoughts and influence on the world.

This principle shares similarities with Rawls' "veil of ignorance," but instead employs what Daniel Kolak calls the "veil of wisdom". 
Instead of ignorance it employs a perfect grasp (perfect knowledge and understanding) of everything. Instead of judging as if I was to be born into one, I need to be judging as if I was to be born into every conscious being. 
The result is an ethical framework that is fundamentally consequentialist-utilitarian in its pursuit of well-being, specifically aligning with preference utilitarianism, as it seeks to reconcile everyone's preferences. 
Even more specific would be the term "negative preference utilitarianism", because, as indicated in the beginning, a desire is a call for change, which would not arise if one is content with one's mental state. 
We do not desire some maximally specific future, but we prefer a future state that avoids what we want to avoid experiencing, which often results in the same overall goal (i.e. when there are only two options), but is more broadly applicable than utility-maximization. 
For example, if the only options are winning or losing, then avoiding to lose is the same as wanting to win. But in general, because we cannot precisely control or even predict the future, we can merely hope to evoke change in the right direction away from what we want to avoid. 
This is in line with Poppers views on science, where, since we cannot know the future, we can only ever hope to find theories that will not get falsified, but we can never actually obtain truth.
